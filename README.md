# AzerothClient
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrowdWare/AzerothClient/master/gui.png)   
AzerothClient is a project to create a library written C++ to have a conversation with AzerothCore (World of Warcraft MMORPG server emulation).  
This client can be used to create a game using Unreal Engine to communicate with AzerothCore, so that you have a game similar to Wrath of the Lichking, but with much better graphics and different content.

## Content
- This solution contains the C++ library named AzerothLib.  
- A Python extension to create a binding between Python and C++.
- And a client gui application written in Python using PySide6. This app can be used for ingame-testing and botting.

## Porting from C#
The library was originally written in C# and will be ported here to C++.
